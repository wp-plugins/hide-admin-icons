Hides the icons in the expanded WordPress 2.7 admin menu.

== Description ==

Hide Admin Icons hides the navigation menu icons and admin page title icons. The menu icons remain visible when the menu is in its collapsed state.

If you'd prefer to keep the big icons next to the page titles just delete a few lines from the `mp_hide_admin_icons.css` file, the code to be removed has been highlighted.

**A few menu and icon related tips:**

* If you're looking to modify the icons in stead of removing them, try the [Tangofy](http://op111.net/p65 "Tangofy") plugin.
* The more horizontally inclined might like Ozh's [Admin Drop Down](http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-admin-menu-drop-down-css/ "Admin Drop Down") plugin, all freshened up for 2.7.

**updates**

* 1.3.1 Nothing fancy, just edited the way the Hide Admin Icons css file is included in the admin header, you shouldn't notice any change really.
* 1.3 Now also removes the icons from admin page headers.
* 1.2 CSS fixed to reflect the 2.7-beta3-9826 html structure.
* 1.1 Fix for code error, tried to retrieve the .css file from incorrect directory. Thanks [Lecactus](http://lecactus.ru "Lecactus") ;)
