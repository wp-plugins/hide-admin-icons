Hides the icons in the expanded WordPress admin menu and admin page titles.

== Description ==

Hide Admin Icons hides the navigation menu icons and admin page title icons. The menu icons remain visible when the menu is in its collapsed state.

== A few menu and icon related tips ==

* If you're looking to modify the icons in stead of removing them, try the [Tangofy](http://op111.net/p65 "Tangofy") plugin.
* The more horizontally inclined might like Ozh's [Admin Drop Down](http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-admin-menu-drop-down-css/ "Admin Drop Down") plugin, all freshened up for 2.7.

== Changelog ==

* 1.3.1 Nothing fancy, just edited the way the Hide Admin Icons css file is included in the admin header, you shouldn't notice any change really.
* 1.3 Now also removes the icons from admin page headers.
* 1.2 CSS fixed to reflect the 2.7-beta3-9826 html structure.
* 1.1 Fix for code error, tried to retrieve the .css file from incorrect directory. Thanks [Lecactus](http://lecactus.ru "Lecactus") ;)
